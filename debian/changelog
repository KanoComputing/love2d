love (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Miriam Ruiz ]
  * New upstream release
    + 0.9.1's API is fully backward compatible with existing 0.9.0 games.
    + Most of the changes are bug fixes, internal code improvements, and
    + some API additions and updates to flesh out LÖVE's features,
    + especially in the love.graphics module.
    + See http://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=77609
    + See https://www.love2d.org/wiki/0.9.1
  * Refreshed patches
  * Temporarily removed the patches to use Glee from system, as Glee 5.5 is
    needed for the program to compile.
